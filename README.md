# Fedora IoT

This is an example repository to demonstrate how Ansible, Podman and Fedora IoT
can be used for a "pull-only" IoT/Edge device.

## Motivation

This repository was mostly created to support some IoT articles over at the
[while-true-do.io blog](https://blog.while-true-do.io). It is meant to hold
some IoT related code, which is used in the articles, but might see another use
in the future.

## Usage

The usage of the repository is explained in
[IoT/Edge - Fedora + Ansible + Podman](blog.while-true-do.io/iot-fedora-ansible-podman/ ).
